# instantColor
Currently does have a code base, but long term this prject plans to use Selenium and Python to create a fully automated version of the @now_in_billions_of_colors Instagram project. This will require 3 main features

-generate new image file based on previous days RGB value
-interact with Instagram HTML to post image and add caption
-run on a webserver so it can be always on and ready to post

I might also use this as an opportunity to learn and work with CloudFlare workers which would mean building the project in JavaScript, but since that is also supported by Selenium that should be doable
